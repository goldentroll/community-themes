Welcome to the repository for Block Themes built by the WordPress community.

## About

## Contributing

You can contribute with code, designs or discussion.

### Getting Started

To get started with development you have a couple of options. You can set up a local environment or you can use the new (WordPress Playground)[https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/] and build your theme online without needing to install anything at all on your machine.

**If you prefer to use the Playground:**

1. Visit the (Playground)[https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/demo/?step=playground&theme=twentytwentythree&plugin=gutenberg&plugin=create-block-theme.1.3.8.zip&url=/wp-admin/index.php]. This instance has the Create Block Theme plugin installed.
1. Go to Appearance/Site Editor and build your theme!
2. Export it using the Create Block Theme plugin under Appearance/Create Block Theme

The Playground has a few limitations and you won't be able to add new fonts to your theme using it.

**If you want to work locally:**

1. Set up a WordPress instance, here is a (handy guide to install WordPress locally)[https://wordpress.org/support/article/installing-wordpress-on-your-own-computer/]
2. Clone / download this repository into your `/wp-content/themes/` directory
3. You may want to install the [Create Block Theme plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/) to help you generate the theme files if you want to build your Theme directly on the Site Editor.

If it's your first time building a Block Theme, we suggest checking the Resources links for more information.

#### Requirements for local setup

- WordPress 6.1+
- PHP 5.6+
